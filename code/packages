nvm         - installing node
supervisor  - no need to restart server while developing
forever     - auto restart the server if it crashes
mocha       - the rising star testing framework
express     - sinatra-like framework (but with the adoption level of rails)
socket.io   - real time stuff
dnode       - call remote function that live in a different process/server (+ callbacks work)

everything from @substack. the guy is a machine.
